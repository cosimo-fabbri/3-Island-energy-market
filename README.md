# 3-Island-energy-market

This university group project, developed during my Erasmus at BI Norwegian Business School for the course “Quantitative Economics,” involves creating an algorithm to assess the equilibrium price in an energy market composed of three interconnected islands.

We demonstrated how changes in cable capabilities impact the market structure, leading to market mergers and price variations. Our analysis provides insights into the economic assumptions and implications of these changes.

Key features:

	•	📈 Algorithm to determine equilibrium prices
	•	🌍 Analysis of interconnected energy markets
	•	🔄 Impact assessment of cable capabilities on market structure and prices

We used Python for this project, leveraging the following libraries:

	•	matplotlib for visualizations
	•	numpy for numerical computations

Please refer to the attached report for a deeper understanding of the economic assumptions and implications of our analysis.
